# NSB.Example.MessageVersioning

This project contains example code that illistrates how to version NServiceBus messages using inheritance.

There is a video that accompanies this example on my blog at https://www.bradjolicoeur.com/Article/nservicebus-message-versioning

Note that there is a branch named InitialVersion that has the initial state I started from in the video.

The main branch contains the final state.

To build this project you will need to add a local nuget package source directed to the folder where the example nuget packages are stored.
